## Features

- The calculator utilizes React as a JavaScript library to create an interactive and dynamic user interface.
- React's `useState` is used to handle values and operations within the calculator.
- The `evaluate` function is employed to evaluate mathematical expressions entered by the user and display the results correctly.
- CSS has been applied to design an attractive and user-friendly interface.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js: [Download and install Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
